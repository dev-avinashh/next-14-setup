## Overview

This project is set up with a **Next.js 14** architecture optimized for performance, scalability, and maintainability. It includes **TypeScript** for type safety, **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling, and pre-commit hooks with **Husky** to enforce code quality standards using **ESLint** and **Prettier**.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework for production-level applications
- **TypeScript** - Strongly-typed JavaScript for maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Husky** - Git hooks for pre-commit and pre-push checks
- **ESLint** - JavaScript and TypeScript linter
- **Prettier** - Code formatting tool

## Features

- **Modular architecture** for scalable and maintainable code
- **Automatic type checking** with TypeScript
- **Utility-first styling** with Tailwind CSS
- **Code quality enforcement** with ESLint and Prettier
- **Pre-commit hooks** with Husky to prevent committing unformatted or error-prone code
